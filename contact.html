          As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is
          designed to build scalable network applications. In the following
          "hello world" example, many connections can be handled concurrently.
          Upon each connection, the callback is fired, but if there is no work
          to be done, Node.js will sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is in contrast to today's more common concurrency model, in which
          OS threads are employed. Thread-based networking is relatively
          inefficient and very difficult to use. Furthermore, users of Node.js
          are free from worries of dead-locking the process, since there are no
          locks. Almost no function in Node.js directly performs I/O, so the
          process never blocks except when the I/O is performed using
          synchronous methods of Node.js standard library. Because nothing
          blocks, scalable systems are very reasonable to develop in Node.js.
        </p>
        <p>
          Node.js is similar in design to, and influenced by, systems like
          Ruby's Event Machine and Python's Twisted. Node.js takes the event
          model a bit further. It presents an event loop as a runtime construct
          instead of as a library. In other systems, there is always a blocking
          call to start the event-loop. Typically, behavior is defined through
          callbacks at the beginning of a script, and at the end a server is
          started through a blocking call like EventMachine::run(). In Node.js,
          there is no such start-the-event-loop call. Node.js simply enters the
          event loop after executing the input script. Node.js exits the event
          loop when there are no more callbacks to perform. This behavior is
          like browser JavaScript — the event loop is hidden from the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTTP is a first-class citizen in Node.js, designed with streaming and
          low latency in mind. This makes Node.js well suited for the foundation
          of a web library or framework.
        </p>
        <p>
          Node.js being designed without threads doesn't mean you can't take
          advantage of multiple cores in your environment. Child processes can
          be spawned by using our child_process.fork() API, and are designed to
          be easy to communicate with. Built upon that same interface is the
          cluster module, which allows you to share sockets between processes to
          enable load balancing over your cores.
